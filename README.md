# [Project Name]

## Description

[Provide a brief description of your Flutter-based Windows application here.]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed on your machine.
- A Windows environment is necessary to run the Windows executable.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for cloning the repository.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone [URL of your Git repository]
   cd [repository name]
   ```

2. **Check for any Flutter setup issues:**
   ```
   flutter doctor
   ```
   Run `flutter doctor` to ensure Flutter is correctly installed and no issues are present.

3. **Get Flutter dependencies:**
   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   For development purposes, you can run the application using:
   ```
   flutter run -d windows
   ```
   To build and run the executable:
   ```
   flutter build windows
   ```
   This will generate an executable in the `build\windows\runner\Release` directory.

### Running the Executable

- Navigate to the `build\windows\runner\Release` directory.
- Run the `.exe` file to start the application.

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any DLL-related issues, ensure that all necessary DLL files are present in the executable directory.
